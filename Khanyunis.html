                    had been struggling with the emotional
                     scars left by the destruction of her neighborhood. 
                      Traumatized by the conflict, she suffered from panic attacks, 
                      nightmares, and a deep sense of fear. Her  parents were desperate to
                     find support for her mental health.

                     they enrolled Amina in a counseling program offered by one of our partner organizations. <br><br>

                    support and how a single resource can change a life.
