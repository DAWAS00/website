             <h1>Our Story </h1>
        <p>
     The primary objective of this project is to explore and address the psychological impact <br>
      of war-related sounds,
     such as bombings and airstrikes, on children living in Gaza. Specifically,
     the project aims to raise awareness about 
    the increasing cases of panic <br>
     attacks among children as a direct result of constant exposure to traumatic war noises. <br>
     By highlighting the urgent need for psychological support and intervention,
     this project <br> seeks to advocate for the mental well-being of Gaza’s children and to develop coping strategies that can help reduce their
      anxiety and fear during times of conflict.</p>
      
      <h1>Our Team</h1>
      <p>
        We are a passionate team of three university students Leen And Bayan <br>
         studying Computer Science and  Dana study Software Engineering. <br>
          United by our dedication to supporting the children of Gaza, 
         we created <br> this platform to raise awareness and provide guidance about panic attacks. <br>
          Through technology and empathy, we aim to make a positive difference in young lives.
